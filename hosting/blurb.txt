Hey! In one hour I'll host the next [Nix Hour](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-nix-hour-a-weekly-nix-q-a-lecture-by-tweag/22767/15), a weekly session where you can join [this meeting](https://meet.zrh.init7.net/nix-hour) and ask any question about Nix, either by voice or chat! These work better the more people there are, so feel free to join even if you don't have a question and complain when something is unclear. We do however also have [a livestream](REPLACEME) if you just want to listen in. There's also https://matrix.to/#/#nix-hour:matrix.org for feedback, discussions and weekly notitifications ðŸ˜„
